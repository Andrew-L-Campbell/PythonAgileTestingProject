# PythonAgileTestingProject
This is a python project I wrote using Agile and made a testing plan that I followed to fix all the bugs.  

I developed this project to monitor a simulated pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen level. I used different alert severity notifications to display if there 
is a problem or not. It is checked every 10 seconds and the data can either be read in by a test input.txt file or by manually entering the values. 

I used the Agile to develop the project and when I was done programming I then used Agile for a testing plan.

The part 1 word document is my test plan and results in testing my program. It has my whole plan from start to finish and the tests I used to find the bugs that was
in my software.
